Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. How long can two people talk about nothing? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. They were just sucked into space. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere!
